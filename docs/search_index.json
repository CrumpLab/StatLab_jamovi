["software.html", "Software 0.2 Data 0.3 JAMOVI", " Software 0.2 Data Data files used for the labs are all taken from open data sources. Links are provided for each lab. For convenience, all of the data files are also available here as single files in the github repository for this lab manual 0.2.1 Data Repository The nice thing about jamovi is that it is able to read different types of data files, from .xls to .sav and much more. https://github.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/tree/master/data 0.3 JAMOVI This is an introducton to jamovi, which is a graphic user interface (GUI) version of R, and is a free, open-source sofware program, and can be installed on most operating systems. The underlying syntax in jamovi is built upon the powerful R programming language, but jamovi itself is particularly designed to perform basic statistical analyses with graphical display of data. With real-time analysis, jamovi generates publication-ready SPSS-like results. For students interested in learning R, jamovi is a great mediator: you can access the R syntax underlying each analysis with one click. This brief intorduction tells you how to install and start using jamovi, and has been adapted from the jamovi user guide. Full version available at: https://www.jamovi.org/user-manual.html 0.3.1 Installing jamovi Download and install jamovi onto your computer using the helpful instructions on this website: https://www.jamovi.org/user-manual.html#installation, which links to the download page here: https://www.jamovi.org/download.html. Once you have completed the installation, jamovi can be accessed on your computer just like any other program. 0.3.2 Opening jamovi Click on the jamovi icon as you would any other program on your computer. You should see a screen that looks something like this (with minor differences depending on your operating system): Figure 0.1: Open screen for jamovi As of the time this lab was written, jamovi was in the 0.9.1.10 version, with new versions still on the way. The three little dots on the right had corner of the screen brings up a menu where updates can be installed automatically, and you will be notified if there are newer versions. It would be wise to stay up-to-date on the versions whenever available. The left part of the opening screen is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is the area where results to any statistical tests appear. This format is very similar to SPSS. You can simply begin typing values into the spreadsheet, and continue on to your desired analysis. At this point, jamovi can only open existing data in the Comma Separated Value or CSV (.csv) format. In the future, jamovi will support files from Microsoft Excel (.xlsx, .xls), SPSS (.sav), and more. So keep an eye out for updates! To open a file, click on the three horizontal lines at the top left hand corner, select Open and then Examples or This PC, depending on whether you want to open an example, or a file stored on your computer. 0.3.3 Adding modules The nice thing about jamovi is that, as new analyses are developed, you can manually add modules that are relevant to you. Just click on the + sign in the top right corner, and you will be directed to a jamovi library. Figure 0.2: jamovi library For now, we will just add the packages called Rj (which is an editor to run R inside jamovi) and scatr (which will help us draw scatter plots): Figure 0.3: Package Rj and scatr 0.3.4 What you should know for this course Learning to use a statistical software program is an essential aspect of any basic statistics course. Experiments generate more data that you can compute manually, so it makes sense to have a software prorgam that can follow your instructions and do the busy work. But the key think to remember is that the software program does not do the thinking for you! You should be know you data well-enough to identify the correct analysis, and use the software to help you. So before you try out the examples in this manual, make sure you know how to solve each problem by hand and understand the underlyign statistical concepts. "],
["lab-1-graphing-data.html", "Chapter 1 Lab 1: Graphing Data 1.1 General Goals 1.2 JAMOVI", " Chapter 1 Lab 1: Graphing Data The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly - to develop strategies of seeing and showing. —Edward Tufte As we have found out from the textbook and lecture, when we measure things, we get lots of numbers. Too many. Sometimes so many your head explodes just thinking about them. One of the most helpful things you can do to begin to make sense of these numbers, is to look at them in graphical form. Unfortunately, for sight-impaired individuals, graphical summary of data is much more well-developed than other forms of summarizing data for our human senses. Some researchers are developing auditory versions of visual graphs, a process called sonification, but we aren’t prepared to demonstrate that here. Instead, we will make charts, and plots, and things to look at, rather than the numbers themselves, mainly because these are tools that are easiest to get our hands on, they are the most developed, and they work really well for visual summary. If time permits, at some point I would like to come back here and do the same things with sonification. I think that would be really, really cool! 1.1 General Goals Our general goals for this first lab are to get your feet wet, so to speak. We’ll do these things: Load in some data to a statistical software program Talk a little bit about how the data is structured Make graphs of the data so we can look at it and make sense of it. 1.1.1 Important info Data for NYC film permits was obtained from the NYC open data website. The .csv file can be found here: Film_Permits.csv Gapminder data from the gapminder project (copied from the R gapminder library) can be downloaded in .csv format here: gapminder.csv 1.2 JAMOVI In this lab, we will get you acquainted with the jamovi software layout and graph some sample data. We will be doing the following: Open jamovi and understand the jamovi layout Load a data file and inspect the data Produce different types of graphs based on data type Your lab instructor will take you through the process of opening the jamovi program. You may double-click on its icon located on the desktop of your lab computer, or you may find it using the Start menu. 1.2.1 Loading and inspecting data You will be downloading and analyzing all kinds of data files this semester. We will follow the very same steps every time. You wil do the following for every data file: Download the data from the given link. Open the downloaded file in jamovi Save a working copy of the file to pratice (so you don’t alter the original data) When you open the data file in jamovi, you will see many rows and columns of data. Each row (except row 1) contains data corresponding to one observation. Row 1 however, contains the names of each variable, which we call the “Header” row. Each column contains data for a single variable, for every observation. Using your mouse to scroll through the data a bit and take a look. A good practice in data analysis is to create copies of your data, in order to rearrange and simplify your data for a specific problem, while maintaining a copy of the original data. 1.2.1.1 Bar Graphs Let’s use jamovi to look at something interesting. For example, what movies are going to be filming in NYC? It turns out that NYC makes a lot of data about a lot things open and free for anyone to download and look at. This is the NYC Open Data website: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us. We are going to look at data for NYC film permits, and you can download the .csv file found here: Film_Permits.csv We will not be working with every single variable in this dataset, but we’ll select a few interesting ones with which to answer questions. Let’s start with borough. Suppose we wanted to know which borough receives the most film permits (you can probably guess which one is most popular). Let’s think about the nature of our question: we would like to know how many permits were filed for each borough. Borough is simply a label or a name for a region, and we want to know the frequency of permits for each borough. This is a nominal scale variable and so, we will appropriately choose a BAR graph to plot it. Let’s use jamovi to produce a bar graph to answer this question. With your data file open, go up to the top menu and follow these steps: 1.2.2 Practice Now, it is your turn. Create a bar plot showing the frequencies for each event type. What can you interpret about the permits based on this plot? 1.2.2.1 Histograms Now, let’s use a different data set to plot a histogram. The defining difference between a histogram and a bar graph (although they look very similar as they both utilize bars) is that a histogram is used to display a continuous variable (interval or ratio scale). In the previous example, boroughs were simply labels or names, so we used a nominal scale and therefore a bar graph. In this example, we use data from the Gapminder project https://www.gapminder.org, which is an organization that collects some really interesting worldwide data. Gapminder data specific to this lab can be downloaded in .csv format here: gapminder.csv Here, we will deal with life expectancy (measured in years), an interval scale measure. Open this file and examine its rows and columns. Each column represents a year during which life expectancy was measured. Each row represents a different country. Let’s first get an idea about life expectancy in general. We want to plot a histogram with life expectancy on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. With your data file open, go up to the top menu and follow these steps: 1.2.3 Practice Now, it is your turn. Create a histogram showing the frequencies for life expectancy, split by continent (Hint: You need to input the variable ‘continent’ into the box ‘Split by’. What can you interpret about the life epectancy based on this plot? "],

It’s sort of an abstract silliness, that sometimes the joke isn’t the star. —Dana Carvey The purpose of this lab is to show you how to compute basic descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median) and variation (range, variance, standard deviation). 2.1 General Goals Compute measures of central tendency using software Compute measures of variation using software Ask some questions of a data set using descriptive statistics 2.1.1 Important info We will be using data from the gapminder project. You can download a small snippet of the data in .csv format from this link (note this dataset was copied from the gapminder library for R) gapminder.csv 2.2 JAMOVI In this lab, we will use jamovi to calculate a variety of descriptive statistics. jamovi allows us to specify which statistics we would like calculated and produce them all in one output table. Here, we will learn to: Calculate descriptive statistics Graph data using a histogram Let’s begin with a short data set {x= 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7} Suppose we want to calculate the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) as well as variability (range, standard deviation, and variance). First, we will have to enter our data into the jamovi spreadsheet. There are 7 measurements, so we will need 7 rows of dat, see below on how to enter data into jamovi. 2.2.1 Descriptive Statistics From here, go to the top menu and choose ‘Exploration’, and a new window will ask you to specify for which variables you want descriptives statistics calculated. Check the ones you want to see, and you will find them displayed on the right. 2.2.2 Descriptive Statistics and Histograms Now let’s use a real dataset to calculate the same measures of central tendency and variability as in the last example, but with the addition of a histogram to visualize a distribution to relate back to the descriptive statistics. Here is a link to the life expectancy dataset we used for our graphing tutorial. href=“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/gapminder.csv” download&gt;gapminder.csv Suppose we wanted to know about life expectancy (around the world) in the year 1952. This will include calculating descriptive statistics, as well as graphing a histogram to examine the distribution of our data. First, we have to filter the data to only include the rows relevant to the year 1952. As with our previous example, we will then click the ‘Exploration’ button next, and choose our measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) as well as variability (range, standard deviation, variance). We will also check the box for histogram in the ‘Plots’ section. Then, jamovi will produce a table of the requested descriptive statistics and a histogram showing the distribution of life expectancy (in years). See the steps below to get the descriptives and histogram: Something to think about: What do the mean, median, and mode indicate about the shape of the distribution? Is it confirmed when we look at the histogram? How does the shape of this distribution compare to the symmetrical normal distribution which is superimposed over it? 2.2.3 Practice Problems Using the life expectancy data set, produce a table of output showing the descriptive statistics (measures of central tendency and variability) for the year 2007. Advanced: Plot histograms of life expectancy for the year 1952 and 2007 on the same scale. How are these distributions different? . "],
["lab-3-correlation.html", "Chapter 3 Lab 3: Correlation 3.1 General Goals 3.2 JAMOVI", " Chapter 3 Lab 3: Correlation If … we choose a group of social phenomena with no antecedent knowledge of the causation or absence of causation among them, then the calculation of correlation coefficients, total or partial, will not advance us a step toward evaluating the importance of the causes at work. —Sir Ronald Fisher In lecture and in the textbook, we have been discussing the idea of correlation. This is the idea that two things that we measure can be somehow related to one another. For example, your personal happiness, which we could try to measure say with a questionnaire, might be related to other things in your life that we could also measure, such as number of close friends, yearly salary, how much chocolate you have in your bedroom, or how many times you have said the word Nintendo in your life. Some of the relationships that we can measure are meaningful, and might reflect a causal relationship where one thing causes a change in another thing. Some of the relationships are spurious, and do not reflect a causal relationship. In this lab you will learn how to compute correlations between two variables in software, and then ask some questions about the correlations that you observe. 3.1 General Goals Compute Pearson’s r between two variables using software Discuss the possible meaning of correlations that you observe 3.1.1 Important Info We use data from the World Happiness Report. A .csv of the data can be found here: WHR2018.csv 3.2 JAMOVI In this lab, we will use jamovi to calculate the correlation coefficient. We will focus on the most-commonly used Pearson’s coefficient, r. We will learn how to: Produce a correlation matrix Produce a scatterplot Let’s first begin with a short data set we will enter into a new jamovi data spreadsheet. Remember, in order to calculate a correlation, you need to have bivariate data; that is, you must have at least two variables, x and y. You can also have more than two variables, as indicated in the section that follows. 3.2.1 Correlation Coefficient for Bivariate Data: Two Variables Let’s use the following data set: {x= 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 5, 8, 9} {y= 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 7, 8, 10, 13}. Notice there are two variables, x and y. Enter these into jamovi and name them appropriately. With your data file open, go up to the top menu and follow these steps: On the right, jamovi will produce an output table containing the correlation matrix requested. Any variable correlated with itself will result in an r of 1. The Pearson r correlation between variables x and y is 0.765. In the event that you have more than two variables in your spreadsheet, and would like to evaluate correlations between several variables taken two at a time, you can enter multiple variables into the correlation window and obtain a correlation matrix–a table showing every possible bivariate correlation amongst a group of variables. To illustrate how this is done, let’s add a new variable to our existing spreadsheet: variable z, {z= 1, 4, 2, 9, 5, 7, 12, 5, 3}. Follow these steps to obtain the correlation matrix: According to this output: 1. The correlation coefficient between variables x and y is .765 2. The correlation coefficient between variables x and z is .294 3. The correlation coefficient between variables y and z is -.080 3.2.2 Correlation and Scatterplots To accompany the calculation of the correlation coefficient, the scatterplot is the relevant visualization tool. Let’s use data from The World Happiness Report World Happiness Report. A .csv of the data can be found here: WHR2018.csv Using this data, let’s answer the following question: does a country’s measure for freedom to make life choices correlate with that country’s measure for Confidence in national government? Let’s find the correlation coefficient between these variables first. With your data file open, go up to the top menu and follow these steps to get the correlation matrix and scatter plot. You can keep this scatterplot as it is, or, you can edit it to include a straight line that best fits the data points. This line is known as the best-fitting line as it minimizes the distance from it to all the data. To add the line, just check the option under ‘Regression Line’ for ‘Linear’. Based on this output, the correlation between Freedom to make life choices and Confidence in national government is .408. This scatterplot is very important. The distance between the line and the data points is indicative of the strength of the correlation coefficient; they are directly related. For example, if the data were more clustered or tighter to the line, the correlation would be stronger. If the data points are more spread out and far from the line, the correlation is weaker. 3.2.3 Practice Problems Find the correlation between “perceptions of corruption” and “positive affect”. Create a scatterplot to visualize this relationship. What are your conclusions about the relationship between affect and perceived corruption? Is this surprising to you? What has happened to log GDP (consider this a measure of GDP) in the United States ONLY with time (as the year has increased)? Explain this relationship and provide a scatterplot. Which country (or countries) have seen a more consistent and strong increase in log GDP over time? Which country (or countries) have seen a decrease over time? "],

Let’s first begin with a short data set we will enter into a new jamovi data spreadsheet. Let’s use the following data set: {x= 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 5, 8, 9}. Enter these into jamovi and name them appropriately. With your jamovi screen open, go up to the top menu and follow these steps: You can include descriptives such as mean and standard deviation for your variables, as outlined in a previous chapter. Go back to data view in your spreadsheet and you will notice a new column of data (a new variable) as been created called Zx. This variable contains the z-scores that correspond to the values in the x columm: 4.2.2 Computing variables If you use the method shown above to convert a set of measurements to z-scores, you don’t need to use this method to do the same thing. However, computing new variables may be useful for more than just converting scores to z-scores, so it’s worth illustrating as well. The take-away message here is that you can use jamovi to create new variables based on existing ones. To illustrate how this is done, let’s work with the data sheet we used in the previous example. Currently, it includes a column for our x variable, and the new Zx variable we created using the ‘Transfor’ option. This time, we are going to turn our x variable measurements into z-scores manually. In order to do this, we’re going to need the necessary components to calculate z-scores: We will need the mean and standard deviation of the x variable. Remember, in the previous section a table of descriptive statistics was generated. We know that the mean of variable x is 4.78 and the standard deviation is 2.64. In order to turn every measurement in variable x into a z-score, then, we must subtract 4.78 from each x, then divide that difference by 2.635. We are going to ask jamovi to do this through the following steps: You may go back to your jamovi spreadsheet. It should now have a new variable listed, new_z, and the computed z-scores should look very similar to the previously calculated z-scores (any differences are due to using rounded figures). You can use this Compute Variable window to calculate z-scores or make any calculations using existing variables. 4.2.3 Practice Problems “Professor, do you grade on a curve?” This is probably the most commonly-asked question in Statistics class. Everyone assumes that grading on a curve will benefit them. But does it? Here is a link to an SPSS file containing 50 students’ exam grades (let’s say it’s the final exam for a Statistics class). Create a table containing the mean and standard deviation for this sample of scores. Now, produce a frequency histogram of the score data. Describe the distribution. Transform each student’s score into a Z-score (you can use either method shown in this tutorial). Now, plot the frequency histogram of this Z-score distribution. Compare it to the raw score distribution. How are they the same? How are they different? Imagine you are a student in this class who received a 90 on this exam. However, the Professor has decided to GRADE ON A CURVE (shock! awe!), such that only the top 10% of the class receives an A (this professor only gives whole grades, no minuses or pluses). Calculate the z-score that corresponds to a raw score of 90 on this exam. Will you get an A with this grade? Why or why not? "],
["lab-5-fundamentals-of-hypothesis-testing.html", "Chapter 5 Lab 5: Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing 5.1 JAMOVI", " Chapter 5 Lab 5: Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing The null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis. —R. A. Fisher 5.1 JAMOVI In this lab, we will use jamovi to: Calculate difference scores between pairs of measures Conduct a sign test 5.1.1 Experiment Background This is a fictitious experiment based on the infamous Coke vs. Pepsi Taste Test Challenge. 20 blindfolded participants were presented with two cups of soda (Coke and Pepsi). Presentation sequence was randomly determined, and participants were required to rate the taste of the soda on a scale from 1-5. 5.1.2 Calculate difference scores between pairs of measures and conduct a sign test First, let’s open the relevant data file; Here is the link; it is called PepsiCoke.sav. We need to calculate, for each participant, the difference between the rating they gave for Coke vs. Pepsi. We will use jamovi to create a new variable (in a new column) containing only difference scores. We will then re-assign the difference scores to indicate preference for Pepsi or Coke. Since we used the calculation “Pepsi - Coke”\", anyone who has a positive difference score preferred the Pepsi better, while anyone with a negative difference score preferred the Coke. Our goal here is not simply to calculate difference scores. We really want to know if there were more instances of preference for one soda over the other. Since the sign tells us who liked Pepsi better or who liked Coke better, comparing the number of pluses to minuses will tell us which soda wins out (and is also the reason this test is called a Sign test). Follow the steps below to accomplish all of this: So, looking at this table, it’s clear that more people preferred Coke (there are 16 positive differences), and much fewer people preferred Pepsi (there are only 4 negative differences). The question is, is this difference (16 vs. 4) large enough to be statistically significant. The table labeled “Test Statistics” answers this question. The binomial distribution is used to obtain a p-value for this exact outcome. The p-value listed in the table is .012. Since this number is less than the commonly used alpha level (.05), we can say that this difference is indeed significant. People significantly prefer Coke over Pepsi in the Taste Test Challenge. (Neither this lab manual nor any of its authors are affiliated with, funded, or in any way associated with the Coca Cola Company) 5.1.3 Entering data for sign test problems What if you aren’t given a set of paired scores? What if your professor asks you to perform a sign test on a single outcome statement? For example: Test the hypothesis that a coin is weighted if, out of 15 flips of the coin, it lands on tails 13 times. Notice that in this problem, there are no pairs of scores. We’re essentially only given the number of signs: out of 15 flips, the coin landed on tails 13 times (you can think of this as 13 pluses) and on heads obviously twice (you can think of this as 2 minuses). Since jamovi needs counts conduct the sign test, you can simply create one column called ‘Con Flip’, and treat each row as a flip. Since you know that 13 of the flips were tails, type Tails in 13 rows and Heads in 2 rows (total of 15 flips).From here, you can conduct a sign test as described above. 5.1.4 Practice Problems In this lab, you will be conducting a sign test to determine whether a coin is weighted. Individually or in small groups, take a coin out of your pocket. If working in groups, use only one coin for the whole group. Now, flip the coin 25 times. Write down how many heads and tails you observed. Enter this into your jamoi spreadsheet and run a sign test using an alpha level of .05. What is your result? Have students in the class (or groups) announce their results as well. Did anyone have a trick coin? Do you think some of the coins used were actually weighted? Why or why not? "],

A series of experiments is a sample drawn from this population. —William Sealy Gossett This lab is modified and extended from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 6.1 Does Music Convey Social Information to Infants? This lab activity uses the open data from Experiment 1 of Mehr, Song, and Spelke (2016) to teach one-sample and paired samples t-tests. Results of the activity provided below should exactly reproduce the results described in the paper. 6.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Parents often sing to their children and, even as infants, children listen to and look at their parents while they are singing. Research by Mehr, Song, and Spelke (2016) sought to explore the psychological function that music has for parents and infants, by examining the hypothesis that particular melodies convey important social information to infants. Specifically, melodies convey information about social affiliation. The authors argue that melodies are shared within social groups. Whereas children growing up in one culture may be exposed to certain songs as infants (e.g., “Rock-a-bye Baby”), children growing up in other cultures (or even other groups within a culture) may be exposed to different songs.Thus, when a novel person (someone who the infant has never seen before) sings a familiar song, it may signal to the infant that this new person is a member of their social group. To test this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 32 infants and their parents to complete an experiment.During their first visit to the lab, the parents were taught a new lullaby (one that neither they nor their infants had heard before).The experimenters asked the parents to sing the new lullaby to their child every day for the next 1-2 weeks. Following this 1-2 week exposure period, the parents and their infant returned to the lab to complete the experimental portion of the study.Infants were first shown a screen with side-by-side videos of two unfamiliar people, each of whom were silently smiling and looking at the infant.The researchers recorded the looking behavior (or gaze) of the infants during this ‘baseline’ phase. Next, one by one, the two unfamiliar people on the screen sang either the lullaby that the parents learned or a different lullaby (that had the same lyrics and rhythm, but a different melody).Finally, the infants saw the same silent video used at baseline, and the researchers again recorded the looking behavior of the infants during this ‘test’ phase.For more details on the experiment’s methods, please refer to Mehr et al.

The data contains all of the measurements from all five experiments in the paper. We are only going to analyze the data from experiment 1 in this example (feel free to try out analyses on the other experiments for practice). 6.4.1 Baseline phase: Conduct a one sample t-test You first want to show that infants’ looking behavior did not differ from chance during the baseline trial. The baseline trial was 16 seconds long. During the baseline, infants watched a video of two unfamilar people, one on the left and one on the right. There was no sound during the basline. Both of the actors in the video smiled directly at the infant. The important question was to determine whether the infant looked more or less to either person. If they showed no preference, the infant should look at both people about 50% of the time. In Experiment 1, values in the Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer variable show the proportion of time that the infant looked to the person who would later sing the familiar song to them. If the average of these proportion is 0.5 (i.e., 50%) across the infants, then we would have some evidence that the infants were not biased at the beginning of the experiment. However, if the infants on average had a bias toward the singer, then the average proportion of the looking time should be different than 0.5. Using a one-sample t-test, we can test the hypothesis that our sample mean for the Baseline was not different from 0.5. To do this in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: Question 1: What option would you choose if you decided to perform a one-tailed t-test? Question 2: Why was the baseline condition important for the experiment? What does performance in this condition tell us? Using the APA guidelines, we would report the results of the one-sample t-test as: During the baseline condition, the mean proportion looking time toward the singer was 0.52, and was not significantly different from 0.5, according to a one-sample test, t(31) = 0.674, p = 0.505. You should take the time to check this result, and see if it is the same one that was reported in the paper. 6.4.2 Test phase Remember how the experiment went. Infants watched silent video recordings of two women (Baseline). Then each person sung a song, one was familiar to the infant (their parents sung the song to them many times), and one was unfamiliar (singing phase). After the singing phase, the infants watched the silent video of the two singers argain (test phase). The critical question was whether the infants would look more to the person who sung the familiar song compared to the person who sun the unfamiliar song. If the infants did this, they should look more than 50% of the time to the singer who sang the familiar song. Test Yourself: Perform a one-sample t-test for the Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer condition by following the steps outlined above. Hint: The only thing you need to change is which variable you include for the test. Make sure you know how to report the result in APA format. Question: Why was the test condition important for the experiment? What does performance in this condition tell us? 6.4.3 Paired-samples t-test The paired samples t-test is easy to do. We’ve already made two variables called Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, and Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. These contain each of the infants looking time proportions to the singer for both parts of the experiment. We can see if the difference between them was likely or unlikely due to chance by running a paired samples t-test. To do this in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: 6.4.3.1 Relationship between one-sample and paired sample t-test Question: Why is it that a paired samples t-test can be the same as the one sample t-test? What do you have to do the data in the paired samples t-test in order to conduct a one-sample t-test that would give you the same result? The one-sample test whether a sample mean is different from some particular mean. The paired sample t-test, is to determine whether one sample mean is different from another sample mean. If you take the scores for each variable in a paired samples t-test, and subtract them from one another, then you have one list of difference scores. Then, you could use a one sample t-test to test whether these difference scores are different from 0. It turns out you get the same answer from a paired sample t-test testing the difference between two sample means, and the one sample t-test testing whether the mean difference of the difference scores between the samples are different from 0. Test Yourself: Conduct the same analysis in jamovi using difference scores. What test would you choose? 6.4.3.2 Usefulness of difference scores Let’s use the difference scores to one more useful thing. Sometime the results of a t-test aren’t intuitively obvious. By the t-test we found out that a small difference between the test phase and baseline was not likely produced by chance. How does this relate to the research question about infants using familiar songs as cues for being social? Let’s ask a very simple question. How many infants actually showed the bias? How many infants out of 32 looked longer at the singer who sang the familiar song during test, compared to during baseline. Here, 22 out of 32 infants showed the effect. To put that in terms of probability, 68.75% of infants showed the effect. These odds and percentages give us another way to appreciate how strong the effect is. It wasn’t strong enough for all infants to show it. 6.4.4 Practice Problems Use the data file from this lab tutorial to test whether the number of frames the baby spent gazing at the familiar song is significantly different than the number of frames spent gazing at the unfamiliar song (use alpha = .05). Report your results in proper statistical reporting format. Compute a new variable representing the difference in number of frames the baby spent gazing between the familiar and unfamiliar song conditions. Test this difference score against a mean of 0 (use alpha=.05). Report your results in proper statistical reporting format. "],

Would you be more likely to get the job after giving a short speech describing your skills, or after writing a short speech and having a potential employer read those words? That was the question raised by Schroeder and Epley (2015).The authors predicted that a person’s speech (i.e., vocal tone, cadence, and pitch) communicates information about their intellect better than their written words (even if they are the same words as in the speech). To examine this possibility, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for Fortune 500 companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a job candidate’s spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job candidate’s pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a single measure of the job candidate’s intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate (a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 - extremely likely). What happened? Did the recruiters think job applicants were smarter when they read the transcripts, or when the heard the applicants speak?

For our analysis, we will focus on only one of the three measures mentioned above: intellect. We want to know if perceived intellect is different in the audio condition (where recruiters listened to a job pitch) than in the transcript condition (where recruiters read a transcript of a job pitch). Lucky for us, the condition variable is called CONDITION. Let’s take a look. There 0s and 1s for each condition (audio vs. transcript). But which one is which? This isn’t clear from the data, and it isn’t clear from the paper, or from the repository. We have to do some guess work. I went ahead and computed the means for the Intellect_rating between each condition, and then compared those to the graph in the paper for E4. It looks like 1 = audio condition, and 0 = transcript condition. Let’s use words instead of 0s and 1s to refer to our experimental conditions. To do this, we will need to change the values of 0 and 1, to the words transcript and audio, and then run the independent samples t-test.To do this in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: We would summarize our results as follows: &gt; Recruiter ratings for audio job pitches are 1.98 points higher than ratings for transcripts of pitches.

A. Fisher This lab is modified and extended from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 8.1 How to not think about bad memories by playing Tetris This lab activity uses the open data from Experiment 2 of James et al. (2015) to teach one-way ANOVA with planned comparisons. Results of the activity provided below should exactly reproduce the results described in the paper. 8.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Following traumatic experiences, some people have flashbacks, which are also called “intrusive memories”\" and are characterized by involuntary images of aspects of the traumatic event. Although people often try to simply forget traumatic memories, this approach is not very effective. Instead, previous research suggests that a better approach may be to try to change aspects of the memory after it is formed. For example, some research shows that traumatic memories can be altered and weakened to the point that they are no longer intrusive. Because intrusive memories of trauma are often visual in nature, James and colleagues (2015) sought to explore whether completing a visuospatial task (e.g., Tetris) after a memory was formed would interfere with the storage of that memory, and thereby reduce the frequency of subsequent intrusions. They hypothesized that only participants who complete a visuo-spatial task after reactivation of the traumatic memories would experience a reduction in intrusive memories. In comparison, simply completing a visuo-spatial task (without reactivation) or reactivation (without a visuo-spatial task), would not reduce the occurrence intrusive memories. In other words, if you play Tetris shortly after you were remembering bad memories, playing Tetris might weaken those memories, which could cause you experience those kinds of intrusive memories less often in the future. 8.1.2 Study Methods To test their hypothesis, the authors conducted an experiment ( N = 72, n = 18 per condition). The procedure is summarized as follows: Trauma Film: All participants viewed a series of video clips of graphic violence (e.g., a person getting hit by a van while using his phone as he crosses the road) as a way to create memories that should become intrusive memories. Participants then went home and recorded the number of intrusive memories they experienced over the next 24 hours. Because this is before the experimental manipulations, all groups were predicted to have an equal occurrence of intrusive memories during the first 24-hours (called Day 0). Experimental Task: After this 24-hour period, the participants returned to the lab and completed the experimental task. The experimenters randomly assigned participants to ONE of the following conditions: No-task control: These participants completed a 10-minute music filler task. Reactivation + Tetris: These participants were shown a series of images from the trauma film to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e., reactivation task). After a 10-minute music filler task, participants played the video game Tetris for 12 minutes. Tetris Only: These participants played Tetris for 12 minutes, but did not complete the reactivation task. Reactivation Only: These participants completed the reactivation task, but did not play Tetris. Intrusive Memories: All participants were asked to record the number of intrusive memories that they experienced over the next seven days (Days 1 to 7). After the seven days had passed, participants completed an Intrusion-Provocation Task, in which they were shown blurred images from the trauma film and asked to indicate whether the blurred image triggered an intrusive memory. 8.2 Lab Skills Learned 8.3 Important Stuff citation: James, E.

(2015) study sought to explore whether completing a visuospatial task (e.g., Tetris) after a memory was formed would interfere with the storage of that memory, and thereby reduce the frequency of subsequent intrusions. They hypothesized that only participants who complete a visuo-spatial task after reactivation of the traumatic memories would experience a reduction in intrusive memories.

The authors conducted an experiment ( N = 72, n = 18 per condition) wherein all participants viewed a series of video clips of graphic violence (e.g., a person getting hit by a van while using his phone as he crosses the road). Pver the next 24 hours, participants recorded their intrusive memories. All groups were predicted to have an equal occurrence of intrusive memories during this pre-manipulation period (called Day 0). Experimental Task: After this 24-hour period, the participants returned to the lab and completed the experimental task. The experimenters randomly assigned participants to ONE of the following conditions: No-task control: These participants completed a 10-minute music filler task. Reactivation + Tetris: These participants were shown a series of images from the trauma film to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e., reactivation task). After a 10-minute music filler task, participants played the video game Tetris for 12 minutes. Tetris Only: These participants played Tetris for 12 minutes, but did not complete the reactivation task. Reactivation Only: These participants completed the reactivation task, but did not play Tetris. Dependent variable: Intrusive Memories: All participants were asked to record the number of intrusive memories that they experienced over the next seven days (Days 1 to 7). 8.4.2 Performing a One-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) &amp; Graphing the data First, let’s open the relevant data file; Here is the link. It’s called “James2015_Experiment2.sav” In this experiment, there was one important independent variable, called condition, and it has four levels. The levels are 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the spreadsheet. These will correspond to the four levels in shown below: No-task control Reactivation Plus Tetris Tetris only Reactivation only The dependent variable is coded in the column Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions. This represents the mean number of intrusions for that week. We are testing the hypothesis that the number of intrusive memories will be different among the groups (1-4). For now, we will not specify which group we think is going to have the highest or lowest number of memories, but rather we will test if there is a difference SOMEWHERE between these 4 groups. 8.4.3 Unplanned Comparisons: Post-hoc tests One way to find the differences between groups in a One-Factor ANOVA is to conduct something called a post-hoc test. This test is referred to as “unplanned” because you only conduct one when you have a significant overall ANOVA. The post-hoc test is neat because it is conveniently summoned during the process of conducting an ANOVA, and presents its results in a compact table. Let’s use a post-hoc test to look at this data. Although there are many types of post-hoc tests, we’re going to conduct the commonly-used Tukey post-hoc test in this example. To conduct the ANOVA and post-hoc tests in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: If you start with row 1, this row compares no-task control with reactivation + tetris. If we find the Sig. column, we see the corresponding p-value for this row is .017. Because this is less than our likely alpha level (.05), this means that these two conditions ARE significantly different from one another. Where else is there a Sig. that is less than alpha (.05)? Reactivation + Tetris compared with Reactivation only has a p-value of .034. This is also a significant difference. These are the only significant differences we see here. This means that, among the 4 groups, only two differences were found: Reactivation + tetris is different from no-task control, and reactivation + tetris is different from reactivation only. 8.4.4 Practice Problems Using this lab’s data set, think about the following question: What if participants’ intrusive memories were not actually affected by the manipulation (tetris and reactivation), but rather the group with the most intrusive memories just happened to react more strongly to the disturbing films? What if there were differences in “level of disturbance” (hint hint: post-film distress rating) among the 4 groups? Test this hypothesis using an alpha level of .05. Report your result in proper statistical reporting format. What do you conclude? Do the same type of analysis to determine whether the amount of attention paid to the film differed between the 4 groups. Report your result in proper statistical reporting format. What do you conclude? "],

A. Fisher 9.1 Betcha can’t type JHDBZKCO very fast on your first try This lab activity uses the data from Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) to teach one-factor repeated measures ANOVA with-up follow comparisons 9.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) used the everyday task of typing on a computer keyboard to ask questions about how people learn to put sequences of actions together. Whenever you type a series of letters on the keyboard, you are putting a sequence of actions together, so typing is task that could be used to measure skilled sequencing. Typing also happens to be a convenient task for measuring sequencing. For example, every time a person types a letter, the timing of the button press and the letter pressed can be measured and stored for later analysis. Behmer &amp; Crump were interested in asking a few different questions, however, we will simplify everything and talk about replication. First we describe an interesting finding from previous research. Behmer &amp; Crump repeated an experiment that should also produce this same finding. If they succeed in doing this, it means the finding can be replicated, and that it happens in more than one lab. Finding from previous resaearch: Prior research showed that typists do something funny. Skilled typists can type normal words very fast. This suggests they know how to locate all of the letters on the keyboard, and can press each letter very quickly to type words. That part isn’t particularly funny. However, if you take really skilled typists and make them type random letters like this: kwitb dhhgjtryq xkldpt mazhyffdt, guess what happens? They slow down a lot. It’s kind of weird that a typist would slow down, after all they can type letters really fast when they appear in words, but not when they appear in random orders…what gives? Last, it turns out that typists are kind of in the middle in terms of speed, if you ask them to type non-words that have similar properties to words, such as: quenp hamlke phwempy. To summarize, prior research showed that typing speed changes as a function of the structure of the text, roughly in this order from fastest to slowest. (FASTEST) Normal Words &lt; Word-like Non-words &lt; Random strings (SLOWEST) Replication question: Behmer &amp; Crump also measured typists while they typed words, non-words that were English-like, and random strings. They had some additional things they were interested in, but for us, we are interested in whether they would show the same effect. Would they replicate the pattern: Normal words (Fastest) &lt; Word-like Non-words (medium) &lt;- Random strings (Slowest)? 9.1.2 Study Methods The authors conducted a repeated measures experiment. A total of 38 subjects were used for the analysis. Independent Variable: The IV Stimulus or typing material had three levels: Normal, Bigrams, and Random. Normal refers to normal 5 letter English words (like truck, or plant). Bigrams refers to non-words that have properties similar to words (e.g., phemt quilp). Random refers to 5 letter strings whose letters were totally random (qmklt gdrzn lprni). Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses) The task: Participants (who happened to also be students from Brooklyn College) sat in front a computer. They were presented with one stimulus (word, bigrams, or random) at a time. As soon as they saw the string of letters, they typed it as quickly and accurately as they could, then they moved on to the next trial. Reminder, this is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions. 9.2 Lab Skills Learned Conducting a one-factor repeated measures ANOVA Conducting follow-up comparisons 9.3 Important Stuff citation: Behmer, Lawrence P., Crump, M.

It’s never simple to keep things simple. Simple solutions require the most advanced thinking. —Richie Norton 10.1 Does standing up make you focus more? This lab activity uses the data from “Stand by your Stroop: Standing up enhances selective attention and cognitive control” (Rosenbaum, Mama, Algom, 2017) to teach the analysis of a 2x2 design using ANOVA. Although the research design is a 2x2 repeated meaures design, we treat the design both as repeated measures, and as a between-subjects design to illustrate how to conduct either type of ANOVA in software. 10.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Do you pay more attention when you are sitting or standing? We analyse the data from “Stand by your Stroop: Standing up enhances selective attention and cognitive control” (Rosenbaum, Mama, Algom, 2017). This paper asked whether sitting versus standing would influence a measure of selective attention, the ability to ignore distracting information. They used a classic test of selective attention, called the Stroop effect. In a typical Stroop experiment, subjects name the color of words as fast as they can. The trick is that sometimes the color of the word is the same as the name of the word, and sometimes it is not. Here are some examples: Congruent trials occur when the color and word match. So, the correct answers for each of the congruent stimuli shown would be to say, red, green, blue and yello. Incongruent trials occur when the color and word mismatch. The correct answers for each of the incongruent stimuli would be: blue, yellow, red, green. The Stroop effect is an example of a well-known phenomena. What happens is that people are faster to name the color of the congruent items compared to the color of the incongruent items. This difference (incongruent reaction time - congruent reaction time) is called the Stroop effect. Many researchers argue that the Stroop effect measures something about selective attention, the ability to ignore distracting information. In this case, the target information that you need to pay attention to is the color, not the word. For each item, the word is potentially distracting, it is not information that you are supposed to respond to. However, it seems that most people can’t help but notice the word, and their performance in the color-naming task is subsequently influenced by the presence of the distracting word. People who are good at ignoring the distracting words should have small Stroop effects. They will ignore the word, and it won’t influence them very much for either congruent or incongruent trials. As a result, the difference in performance (the Stroop effect) should be fairly small (if you have “good” selective attention in this task). People who are bad at ignoring the distracting words should have big Stroop effects. They will not ignore the words, causing them to be relatively fast when the word helps, and relatively slow when the word mismatches. As a result, they will show a difference in performance between the incongruent and congruent conditions. If we take the size of the Stroop effect as a measure of selective attention, we can then start wondering what sorts of things improve selective attention (e.g., that make the Stroop effect smaller), and what kinds of things impair selective attention (e.g., make the Stroop effect bigger). The research question of this study was to ask whether standing up improves selective attention compared to sitting down. They predicted smaller Stroop effects when people were standing up and doing the task, compared to when they were sitting down and doing the task. 10.1.2 Study Methods The design of the study was a 2x2 repeated-measures design. The first IV was congruency (congruent vs incongruent). The second IV was posture (sitting vs. standing). The DV was reaction time to name the word.

Selective attention here is measured as performance on the Stroop task. In a typical Stroop experiment, subjects name the color of words as fast as they can. The trick is that sometimes the color of the word is the same as the name of the word, and sometimes it is not. The design of the study was a 2x2 design. The first IV was congruency (congruent vs incongruent). The second IV was posture (sitting vs. standing). The DV was reaction time (RT)to name the word. 10.4.2 Conduct a Between-Subjects Two-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Here is a link to our data file. It is named stroopsit.sav. Notice that in this file, there are 200 rows (corresponding to 200 subjects). Each subject is categorized according to 2 independent variables: posture (whether they were in the standing or sitting condition), and congruency (whether the stimuli they received were congruent or incongruent). In this application, we are treating the design as between-subjects. This means each participant only experienced one of the following four conditions: congruent stand incongruent stand congruent sit incongruent sit To conduct a two-factor between-subjects ANOVA with post-hoc tests in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: You can see from this output that: There is no main effect of posture, F(1, 196)=2.449, p=NS There is a main effect of congruency, F(1, 196)=43.734, p&lt;.05 where (from looking at the plot) incongruent stimuli were processed with a longer reaction time than congruent stimuli. There is no interaction between posture and congruency, F(1, 196)=.497, p=NS 10.4.3 Conduct a Repeated Measures Two-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ext, we will use this same data but treat it as a repeated measures (within-subjects) design (just as in the original experiment). This means each person in the study experienced ALL 4 conditions. To start, we need a new data file. Here is link. This data file is called stroopsit_RM.sav. I have set it up so that the data is arranged for a repeated-measures design. Notice that each person is represented by a single row, and the columns correspond to the 4 conditions. To conduct a two-factor repeated-subjects ANOVA with post-hoc tests in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: According to this output: 1. There is a main effect of congruency, F(1, 49)=342.45, p&lt;.05. 2. There is a main effect of posture, F(1, 49)=7.33, p&lt;.05. 3. There is an interaction effect between congruency and posture, F(1, 49)=8.96, p&lt;.05. 10.4.4 Practice Problems Below is fictitious data representing the number of milliimeters a plant has grown under several water/sunlight combinations: Water &amp; Sunlight NoWater &amp; Sunlight Water &amp; NoSunlight NoWater &amp; NoSunlight 1.2 2.4 3.1 2.5 3.0 1.1 2.2 3.4 2.5 1.2 2.5 4.2 1.6 2.4 4.3 2.1 Enter this data into jamovi as appropriate for a Two-Factor Between-Subjects ANOVA (N=16).

People take pictures of things all the time on their phones. Barasch et al. (2017) asked whether taking pictures of things had consequences for later memory of those experiences. 11.1.1 Study description In Experiment 1, participants visited a museum exhibit. Half of the participants were allowed to take photographs (with camera, at least 10 pictures) and the other half were not (no camera). They freely looked at anything in the exhibit, and were allowed to take pictures of anything they wanted (if they were in the camera condition). Additionally, while visiting the exhibit, participants listened to audio guides about the things the were looking at. After participants were done with the exhibit the returned to the sign-in desk. At this point they were given two memory tests for the things they saw and heard in the exhibit. They were given a visual recognition test containing pictures of objects, and were asked to identify which objects they remembered seeing. They were also given an auditory recognition test containing statements that could have been on the audio guide, and they had to identify which ones they had heard before. This is a 2x2 mixed design. IV 1 was a between-subjects manipulation involving picture-taking (camera vs. no camera). IV2 was a within-subject manipulation of memory test (visual vs. audio). The dependent measure was performance on the memory test. An overarching question was whether or not participants would have better visual memory for exhibit objects when they took pictures, compared to when they didn’t. Additionally, taking pictures or not, may have no influence on memory for the statements in the audio guide. 11.2 Lab Skills Learned Conducting a 2x2 mixed design ANOVA 11.3 Important Stuff citation: Barasch, A., Diehl, K., Silverman, J., &amp; Zauberman, G.

Barasch et al. (2017) asked whether taking pictures of things had consequences for later memory of those experiences. In this experiment participants visited a museum exhibit. Half the participants were able to use a camera to document their visit, while the other half were not, all while listening to an audio tour of the exhibit. At the end of the visit, everyone was given two memory tests (visual and audio) for the content they saw and heard, respectively. This is a 2x2 Mixed-Factorial design. The individuals in the photo group are different than the individuals in the no photo group (this is our between-subjects variable–it is called condition), while the memory test_type (audio and visual) is our within-subjects variable since everyone took both types of tests. 11.4.2 Conduct a Mixed-Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Open the data file linked here. It is called “study1_data_photo.sav”. Scroll through the file. Find the variable named condition. This variable tells you if the row in question corresponds to a person who was or was not able to use a camera. Now, find the variables apercent and vpercent. These variables refer to the percentage score received by everyone on the audio and visual memory tests, respectively. Notice that every row in the data file only has ONE “condition” label. That is, you were either in the camera or no camera condition. BUT, everyone in the file has scores for BOTH tests, audio and visual. This is the way your data must be structed in jamovi in order to perform a mixed-factorial ANOVA. To conduct a mixed-design ANOVA with post-hoc tests in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics: Let’s look at our output tables. Based on its values, we can tell that: There is a significant main effect of test type, F(1, 295)=108.59, p&lt;.05. Overall, memory test scores were higher for the audio test than the video test. There is a significant ineraction effect between test type and condition, F(1, 295)=13.79, p&lt;.05. People taking photos did worse on the audio test than people without photos, however, on the visual test, people taking photos did better than those who did not take photos. There is no significant main effect of condition, F(1, 295)=2.26, p=NS. 11.4.3 Practice Problems Using the same data file we used for this lab’s tutorial, run a Mixed-Factorial ANOVA using test type (audio and visual) and Gender (Male, Female).
